A.	Choose the right answer of the following questions.
1.	Kansas is known for many things -- wheat, sunflowers ... and tornadoes! What famous story set in Kansas features a tornado? The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, by L. Frank Baum, tells the story of Dorothy, who gets caught in a Kansas tornado and lands in the imaginary land of Oz. Tornadoes are storms with rapidly rotating winds that form a funnel cloud. Also known as "twisters," they extend downward from the huge clouds of a severe thunderstorm. The winds that rotate within a tornado usually reach a speed of almost 300 miles per hour! A tornado often sweeps through an area quickly, but it can cause considerable destruction. There have been a number of remarkable reports of tornadoes. In one instance, a schoolhouse was demolished while the 85 students originally inside it were carried more than 400 feet with none killed.

Apakah produk yang sudah mendapat status dari BPOM sebagai produk berbasis susu memang punya kandungan gizi atau tidak. Guru Besar IPB Ahmad Sulaeman menjelaskan bahwa susu kental manis terbuat dari susu segar, kemudian ada kandungan lain seperti susu skim, susu skim powder, gula, susu bubuk whey, buttermilk powder, serta palm oil.(1) Melihat kandungan tersebut, Ketua Pusat Kajian Gizi dan Kesehatan Universitas Indonesia (PKGK  UI) Ahmad Syafiq menyimpulkan bila produk susu kental manis punya kandungan energi karena telah ditambahkan gula. (2) Penambahan gula berfungsi untuk mencegah kerusakan produk. (3) Produk susu kental manis tersebut lantas dipasteurisasi dan dikemas secara kedap (hermetis). (4) Susu kental manis tidak masalah untuk dikonsumsi asalkan tidak berlebihan, namun susu kental manis ini tidak cocok untuk dikonsumsi bayi sebagai pengganti ASI.Pernyataan tidak setuju dalam teks tersebut ditandai dengan nomor … a. 2 b. 4 c. 3 d. 1​</a>

Also known as "twisters," they extend downward from the huge clouds of a severe thunderstorm. The winds that rotate within a tornado usually reach a speed of almost 300 miles per hour! A tornado often sweeps through an area quickly, but it can cause considerable destruction. There have been a number of remarkable reports of tornadoes. In one instance, a school house was demolished while the 85 students originally inside it were carried more than 400 feet with none killed.
