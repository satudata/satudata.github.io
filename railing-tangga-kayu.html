                                            Once upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t havea child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Pleasegive us a child,” they asked God everyday.One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cutecry, “Waa! Waa!”They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like alittle figer. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!”“We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said.They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshinever grew bigger.“Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?”Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the villageand often went home feeling unhappy.Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encouragehim. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said.One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study andbecome a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfatherand Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mindwould not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, puton a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, inhigh spirits.“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather andGrandmother asked as they saw him off.Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.… … …At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchoredunder the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed thetown.“There is a fie palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”“Here I am, at your feet.”“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”“Please let me be your retainer.”“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”“I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” WhenIssumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshiyelled, stabbing the bee.“Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became thePrincess’s man.”“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, puttingIssumboshi on her palm.“I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading,writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencingvery hard in order to be strong.One day the Princess went out to worship at the KiyomizuTemple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demonsappeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess.“Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but thedemon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi,who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. Thedemon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. Theremaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste,but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding themagic hammer.“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked.“Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant youa wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ranoff in a hurry.“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” thePrincess said.“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wishthat I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved itand asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began togrow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace,and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi.The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and theyinvited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in thepalace. They lived happily ever after.TOLONG DIRINGKAS​</a>

                                            Once upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t have
a child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please
give us a child,” they asked God everyday.
One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute
cry, “Waa! Waa!”
They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a
little figer. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!”
“We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said.
They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi
never grew bigger.
“Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?”
Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village
and often went home feeling unhappy.
Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage
him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said.
One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study and
become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather
and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind

Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put

high spirits.
“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.
“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and
Grandmother asked as they saw him off.
Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.
… … …
At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored
under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the
town.
“There is a fie palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”
At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.
“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”

The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer.“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked.“Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry.“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said.“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man.

Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said.
One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study and become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.
Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits.
“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.
“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off.
Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.

“There is a fine palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”
At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.
“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”
The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”
“Here I am, at your feet.”
“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”
“Please let me be your retainer.”
“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”

“Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.”
“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm.
 “I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.
The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong.
One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess. “Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.
Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer.
“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked.
“Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry.
“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said.
“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”

                                            Once upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t have
a child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please
give us a child,” they asked God everyday.
One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute
cry, “Waa! Waa!”
They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a
little figer. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!”
“We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said.
They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi
never grew bigger.
“Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?”
Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village
and often went home feeling unhappy.
Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage
him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said.
One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study and
become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather
and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind
would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.
Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put
on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in
high spirits.
“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.
“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and
Grandmother asked as they saw him off.
Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.
… … …
At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored
under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the
town.
“There is a fie palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”
At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.
“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”
The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”
“Here I am, at your feet.”
“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”
“Please let me be your retainer.”
“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”
“I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When
Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi
yelled, stabbing the bee.
“Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the
Princess’s man.”
“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting
Issumboshi on her palm.
“I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.
The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading,
writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing
very hard in order to be strong.
One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu
Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons
appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess.
“Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the
demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi,
who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The
demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.
Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The
remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste,
but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the
magic hammer.
“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked.
“Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you
a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran
off in a hurry.
“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the
Princess said.
“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish
that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it
and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”
And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to

Once upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t have a child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please give us a child,” they asked God everyday.
One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute cry, “Waa! Waa!” 
They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a little finger. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!”
“We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said. 
They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi never grew bigger.
“Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?” Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village and often went home feeling unhappy.
Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said.
One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study and become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.
Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits.
“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.
“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off. Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.… … …
At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town.
“There is a fine palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.
“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.
” The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”
“Here I am, at your feet.”
“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”
“Please let me be your retainer.”
“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”
“I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi yelled, stabbing the bee.
“Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.”
“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm.
“I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.
The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong.
One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess. “Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.
Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer.
“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked.
“Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry.
“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said.
“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”
And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace, and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi. 
The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever after.</a>

     One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study and become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits.“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and Grandmother asked as they saw him off. Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.… … …At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the town.
“There is a ne palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”
At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.” The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”“Here I am, at your feet.”“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”“Please let me be your retainer.”“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”“I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi  yelled, stabbing the bee.“Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the Princess’s man.” 
“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting Issumboshi on her palm.
 “I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi. The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading, writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing very hard in order to be strong.One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu  Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess. “Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi, who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste, but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the magic hammer.“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked. “Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran off in a hurry.“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the Princess said.“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace, and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi. The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever after.</a>

                        <p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>Dahulu kala ada pasangan tua yang tidak memiliki</p><p> Seorang anak.  Mereka tinggal di sebuah rumah kecil di dekat hutan desa.  "Silahkan</p><p> beri kami seorang anak,” mereka meminta Tuhan setiap hari.</p><p> Suatu hari, dari altar rumah tangga Shinto, mereka mendengar suara lucu</p><p> menangis, “Wah!  Waa!”</p><p> Mereka melihat dan melihat bayi yang menangis yang tampak seperti</p><p> kecil.  “Anak ini pasti hadiah dari Tuhan.  Terimakasih Tuhan!"</p><p> "Kami akan memanggil anak ini 'Isumboshi'," kata mereka.</p><p> Mereka membesarkan Issumboshi dengan sangat hati-hati, tapi Issumboshi</p><p> tidak pernah tumbuh lebih besar.</p><p> “Hei, Issumboshi, apakah kamu ingin dimakan oleh katak?”</p><p> Issumboshi selalu diganggu oleh anak-anak desa</p><p> dan sering pulang dengan perasaan tidak senang.</p><p> Nenek akan membuat beberapa bola nasi besar dan menyemangati</p><p> dia.  “Makan yang banyak, dan cepat dewasa,” kata Nenek.</p><p> Suatu hari, Isumboshi berkata, “Saya akan pergi ke ibu kota untuk belajar dan</p><p> menjadi orang yang terhormat.  Lalu aku akan kembali.”  Kakek</p><p> dan Nenek mengkhawatirkannya, tapi pikiran Issumboshi</p><p> tidak akan diubah.  Segera mereka mulai mempersiapkan perjalanannya.</p><p> Issumboshi menyarungkan pedang jarum dalam kotak jerami, taruh</p><p> pada cangkir untuk topi sedge, dan mulai dengan tongkat sumpit, di</p><p> semangat tinggi.</p><p> "Aku pergi sekarang," kata Issumboshi.</p><p> “Apakah dia aman?  Dengan tubuh sekecil itu?”  Kakek dan</p><p> Nenek bertanya saat mereka mengantarnya pergi.</p><p> Issumboshi melanjutkan perjalanan dengan keinginan besar dalam tubuh kecil.</p><p> … … …</p><p> Akhirnya Issumboshi mencapai ibu kota dan berlabuh</p><p> di bawah jembatan.  Kemudian dia naik ke pagar dan melihat</p><p> kota.</p><p> “Ada istana api di sana.  Saya akan bertanya kepada mereka segera. ”</p><p> Akhirnya Issumboshi tiba di istana.</p><p> "Maaf, tapi saya ingin bertemu tuan feodal."</p><p> Tuan datang ke pintu, “Apa?  Siapa disana?"</p><p> "Ini aku, di kakimu."</p><p> "Oh.  Betapa kecilnya!  Kenapa kau ingin bertemu denganku?”</p><p> "Tolong biarkan aku menjadi pengikutmu."</p><p> "Aku ingin tahu apakah tubuhmu yang sangat kecil bisa melakukan apa saja."</p><p> "Aku akan tetap di sakumu dan menjagamu dari semua bahaya."  Kapan</p><p> Issumboshi berkata begitu, seekor lebah datang berdengung.  “Ya!”  Issumboshi</p><p> teriak, menusuk lebah.</p><p> “Bravo!  Saya mempekerjakan Anda.  Akan lebih baik jika kamu menjadi</p><p> Laki-laki Putri.”</p><p> "Oh!  Betapa lucunya dia!”  kata Putri, menempatkan</p><p> Issumboshi di telapak tangannya.</p><p> "Aku akan membelamu seumur hidupku," kata Issumboshi.</p><p> Sang Putri menyukai Issumboshi, dan dia mengajarinya membaca,</p><p> menulis, dan berbagai penelitian.  Selanjutnya, Issumboshi berlatih anggar</p><p> sangat keras untuk menjadi kuat.</p><p> Suatu hari sang Putri pergi untuk beribadah di Kiyomizu</p><p> Kuil.  Tiba-tiba ada angin kencang, dan beberapa setan</p><p> muncul.  Pemimpin iblis mencoba meraih Putri.</p><p> "Tolong aku!"  dia berteriak.  Issumboshi mencoba membantunya, tapi—</p><p> setan menangkapnya dan melemparkannya ke mulutnya.  Issumboshi,</p><p> yang ditelan, ditusuk dan ditusuk perut setan.  Itu</p><p> iblis berguling dan meludahkan Issumboshi.</p><p> Issumboshi melompat ke arah iblis dan menusuk matanya.  Itu</p><p> setan yang tersisa ketakutan.  Mereka melarikan diri dengan sangat tergesa-gesa,</p><p> tetapi satu iblis, yang tertinggal, gemetar sambil memegang</p><p> palu ajaib.</p><p> "Apakah kamu ingin aku menusuk matamu juga?"  tanya Issumboshi.</p><p> “Tolong, jangan.  Ini adalah palu ajaib yang akan memberimu</p><p> sebuah harapan.  Saya memberikannya kepada Anda, jadi tolong lepaskan saya. ”  Dan mengatakan ini, dia berlari</p><p> pergi terburu-buru.</p><p> “Terima kasih, Issumboshi.  Anda telah menyelamatkan hidup saya, ”</p><p> kata Putri.</p><p> “Putri, tolong lambaikan palu ajaib ini dan buat permintaan</p><p> agar aku bisa menjadi besar,” kata Issumboshi.  Sang Putri melambaikannya</p><p> dan bertanya, “Semoga Issumboshi menjadi besar!”</p><p> Dan kemudian, anehnya, di depan matanya, Issumboshi mulai—</p><p> tumbuh.  Dia tumbuh menjadi pemuda yang baik.  Mereka kembali ke istana,</p><p> dan Putri meminta Raja untuk mengizinkannya menikahi Issumboshi.</p><p> Putri dan Issumboshi kemudian menikah, dan mereka</p><p> mengundang Kakek dan Nenek untuk tinggal bersama mereka di</p><p> istana.  Mereka hidup bahagia selamanya ke bh indo</p><p></p><br />

                            5. Once upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t have
a child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please
give us a child,” they asked God everyday.
One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute
cry, “Waa! Waa!”
They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a
little figer. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!”
“We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said.
They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi
never grew bigger.
“Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?”
Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village
and often went home feeling unhappy.
Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage
him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said.
One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study and
become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather
and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind
would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.
Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put
on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in
high spirits.
“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.
“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and
Grandmother asked as they saw him off.
Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.
… … …
At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored
under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the
town.
“There is a fie palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”
At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.
“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”
The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”
“Here I am, at your feet.”
“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”
“Please let me be your retainer.”
“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”
“I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When
Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi
yelled, stabbing the bee.
“Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the
Princess’s man.”
“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting
Issumboshi on her palm.
“I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.
The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading,
writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing
very hard in order to be strong.
One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu
Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons
appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess.
“Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the
demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi,
who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The
demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.
Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The
remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste,
but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the
magic hammer.
“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked.
“Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you
a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran
off in a hurry.
“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the
Princess said.
“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish
that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it
and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”
And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to
grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace,
and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi.
The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they
invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the
palace. They lived happily ever after.

“There is a fie palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”
At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.
“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”
The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”
“Here I am, at your feet.”
“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”
“Please let me be your retainer.”
“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”
“I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” When
Issumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshi
yelled, stabbing the bee.
“Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became the
Princess’s man.”
“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, putting
Issumboshi on her palm.
“I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.
The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading,
writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencing
very hard in order to be strong.
One day the Princess went out to worship at the Kiyomizu
Temple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demons
appeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess.
“Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but the
demon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi,
who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. The
demon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.
Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. The
remaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste,
but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding the
magic hammer.
“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked.
“Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant you
a wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ran
off in a hurry.
“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” the
Princess said.
“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wish
that I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved it
and asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”
And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began to
grow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace,
and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi.
The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they
invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the
palace. They lived happily ever after.

                        Dahulu kala ada pasangan tua yang tidak punya anak. Mereka tinggal di sebuah rumah kecil di dekat hutan desa. "Tolong beri kami anak kecil," mereka bertanya kepada Tuhan setiap hari. Suatu hari, dari altar Shinto rumah tangga, mereka mendengar teriakan imut, "Waa! Waa! "Mereka melihat dan melihat bayi yang menangis yang tampak seperti sedikit harimau. "Anak ini pasti hadiah dari Tuhan. Terima kasih kepada Tuhan! "" Kami akan memanggil anak ini 'Issumboshi', "kata mereka. Mereka mengangkat Issumboshi dengan sangat hati-hati, tapi Issumboshi tidak pernah tumbuh lebih besar. "Hei, Issumboshi, apakah kamu mau dimakan kodok?" Issumboshi selalu diintimidasi oleh anak-anak desa dan sering pulang merasa tidak bahagia. Nenek akan membuat beberapa bola nasi besar dan mendorongnya. "Makanlah banyak, dan tumbuh dengan cepat," kata Nenek. Suatu hari, Issumboshi berkata, "Saya akan pergi ke ibu kota untuk belajar dan menjadi orang yang terhormat. Lalu aku akan kembali. "Kakek dan Nenek mengkhawatirkannya, tapi pikiran Issumboshi tidak akan berubah. Seketika mereka mulai mempersiapkan perjalanannya. Issumboshi menyisipkan pedang jarum dalam kotak jerami, mengenakan secangkir topi sedimen, dan memulai dengan tongkat sumpit dengan semangat tinggi. "Aku pergi sekarang," kata Issumboshi. "Apakah dia aman? Dengan tubuh kecil seperti itu? "Kakek dan Nenek bertanya saat mereka melihat dia pergi. Issumboshi melanjutkan perjalanan dengan harapan besar di tubuh kecil. ... ... ... Akhirnya Issumboshi sampai di ibu kota dan berlabuh di bawah jembatan. Lalu dia naik ke pagar dan memandang kota. "Ada istana di sana. Saya akan segera bertanya kepada mereka. "Akhirnya Issumboshi tiba di istana. "Permisi, tapi saya ingin bertemu dengan tuan tanah feodal." Sang tuan datang ke pintu, "Apa? Siapa di sana? "" Ini aku, di kakimu. "" Oh. Seberapa kecil Mengapa Anda ingin bertemu dengan saya? "" Tolong biarkan saya menjadi pengikut Anda. "" Saya ingin tahu apakah tubuh Anda yang sangat kecil dapat melakukan apapun. "" Saya akan tinggal di saku Anda dan menjagamu dari segala bahaya. "Ketika Issumboshi berkata Jadi, lebah datang berdengung. "Yhaa!" Issumboshi berteriak, menikam lebah. "Bravo! Saya mempekerjakan anda Alangkah baiknya jika Anda menjadi putra Putri. "" Oh! Betapa manisnya dia! "Kata Putri sambil meletakkan Issumboshi di telapak tangannya. "Saya akan membela Anda seumur hidup saya," kata Issumboshi. Putri menyukai Issumboshi, dan dia mengajarinya membaca, menulis, dan berbagai penelitian. Selanjutnya, Issumboshi mempraktikkan anggar dengan sangat keras agar menjadi kuat. Suatu hari sang Putri pergi untuk beribadah di Kuil Kiyomizu. Tiba-tiba ada angin kencang, dan beberapa setan muncul. Pemimpin setan mencoba meraih Putri. "Bantu aku!" Teriaknya. Issumboshi mencoba membantunya, tapi setan itu menangkapnya dan melemparkannya ke dalam mulutnya. Issumboshi, yang tertelan, menusuk dan menusukkan perut iblisnya. Iblis itu meluncur dan meludahkan Issumboshi. Issumboshi melompat ke arah setan dan menikam matanya. Iblis yang tersisa ketakutan. Mereka berlari dengan tergesa-gesa, tapi satu setan, yang tertinggal, gemetaran sambil memegang palu ajaib. "Apakah Anda ingin saya menusuk matamu juga?" Tanya Issumboshi. "Tolong, jangan. Inilah palu ajaib yang akan memberi Anda sebuah harapan. Aku memberikannya padamu, jadi tolong lepaskan aku. "Dan mengatakan ini, dia kabur terburu-buru. "Terima kasih, Issumboshi. Kamu telah menyelamatkan hidupku, "kata Putri. "Putri, tolong nyalakan palu ajaib ini dan buat harapan agar saya menjadi besar," kata Issumboshi. Putri mengayunkannya dan bertanya, "May Issumboshi menjadi besar!" Dan kemudian, anehnya, di depan matanya, Issumboshi mulai tumbuh. Dia tumbuh menjadi pemuda yang baik. Mereka kembali ke istana, dan Putri meminta Raja untuk mengizinkannya menikahi Issumboshi.

                            17. Once upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t have
a child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Please
give us a child,” they asked God everyday.
One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cute
cry, “Waa! Waa!”
They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like a
little figer. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!”
“We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said.
They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshi
never grew bigger.
“Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?”
Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the village
and often went home feeling unhappy.
Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encourage
him. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said.
One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study and
become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather
and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind
would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.
Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put
on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in
high spirits.
“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.
“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather and
Grandmother asked as they saw him off.
Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.
… … …
At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchored
under the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed the
town.
“There is a fie palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”
At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.
“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”
The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”
“Here I am, at your feet.”
“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”
“Please let me be your retainer.”

One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study and become a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfather and Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mind would not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.
Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, put on a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, in high spirits.
“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.

The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and they invited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in the palace. They lived happily ever after. artinya​</h2><br />

Mereka tinggal di sebuah rumah kecil di dekat hutan desa. "Kami mohon, berikan kami anak," pinta mereka kepada Tuhan setiap hari. </p><p></p><p>﻿Suatu hari, mereka mendengar sebuah tangisan dari altar Shinto mereka. "Waa! Waa!" Terlihat seorang bayi yang sedang menangis dan berukuran sebesar jari kecil. "Bayi ini pastilah karunia dari Tuhan! Terima kasih, Tuhan! "Kita akan menamakannya 'Issumboshi'," ujar mereka. </p><p></p><p>﻿Mereka merawat Issumboshi dengan penuh kasih sayang, tetapi Ia tidak juga tumbuh besar. "Hei Issumboshi, apa kau mau dimakan oleh katak?" Issumboshi selalu dirundung oleh anak-anak desa dan selalu pulang dengan sedih. Biasanya Nenek membuatkannya bola-bola nasi besar dan menyemangatinya. "Makanlah yang banyak, dan tumbuhlah cepat," kata sang Nenek. </p><p></p><p>Suatu hari, Issumboshi berkata, "aku akan pergi ke ibukota untuk belajar dan menjadi orang terhormat. Lalu, aku akan kembali," Kakek dan Nenek merasa khawatir, tapi pikiran Issumboshi sudah mantap. Dengan segera mereka mulai mempersiapkan perjalanannya.</p><p></p><p>Issumboshi menyarungkan pedang jarumnya, mengenakan cangkir sebagai topinya, dan keluar dengan sumpit sebagai tongkatnya, dengan semangat yang tinggi. "Aku akan berangkat sekarang," ujar Issumboshi.</p><p></p><p>"Akankah dia tetap aman? Dengan badannya yang kecil?" Tanya Kakek dan Nenek saat mereka melihatnya pergi. Issumboshi berangkat dengan harapan yang besar dalam tubuh kecilnya.</p><p></p><p>Akhirnya Issumboshi sampai di ibukota dan berlabuh di bawah jembatan. Lalu Ia memanjat pagar dan memandang kota tersebut. "Ada istana yang indah disana. Aku harus bertanya kepada orang disana." </p><p></p><p>Tak lama kemudian Issumboshi sampai di istana. "Permisi, saya ingin bertemu dengan Raja." Sang Raja membuka pintu," apa? Siapa disana?" "Saya disini, di kaki Tuan." "Oh. Betapa kecilnya kau! Mengapa kau mau menemuiku?" "Saya ingin menjadi pelayan Tuan." "Saya ragu apakah tubuhmu yang sangat kecil memungkinkanmu melakukan tugas itu." "Saya akan tinggal di saku Tuan dan menjaga Tuan dari bahaya."</p><p></p><p>Ketika Issumboshi berkata demikian, seekor lebah terbang mendekati mereka. "Yhaa!" Jerit Issumboshi, menusuk lebah tersebut. "Hebat! Kau diterima. Akan baik jika kau menjadi pelayan Putri." "Oh! Betapa imutnya dia!" Ujar sang Putri, sembari meletakkan Issumboshi pada telapak tangannya. "Saya akan melindungi Putri dengan segenap jiwa," ujar Issumboshi.</p><p></p><p>Sang Putri menyukai Issumboshi, dan Ia mengajarkannya membaca, menulis, dan berbagai ilmu lain. Selanjutnya, Issumboshi berlatih anggar dengan tekun agar dapat menjadi kuat.</p><p></p><p>Suatu hari, sang Putri pergi berdoa ke Kuil Kiyomizu. Tiba-tiba angin berhembus dengan sangat kencang, dan beberapa iblis muncul. Pemimpin iblis berusaha menangkap sang Putri. "Tolong aku!" Teriaknya. Issumboshi berusaha membantunya, tetapi iblis itu menangkapnya dan melemparnya kedalam mulutnya. Issumboshi, yang sudah ditelan, menusuk dan menusuk perut iblis tersebut. Iblis itu terguling dan memuntahkannya. Issumboshi melompat dan menusuk matanya.</p><p></p><p>Iblis-iblis lain ketakutan. Mereka melarikan diri tergesa-gesa, tetapi ada satu iblis yang tertinggal, bergemetar sambil memegang sebuah palu ajaib. "Apa kau mau aku menusuk matamu juga?" Tanya Issumboshi. "Tolong jangan. Ini adalah palu ajaib yang dapat mengabulkan permintaan. Saya berikan kepadamu, jadi tolong ampuni saya." Setelah itu, Ia melarikan diri. </p><p></p><p>"Terima kasih, Issumboshi. Kau sudah menyelamatkan hidupku," ucap sang Putri. "Putri, tolong ayunkan palu ini dan buatlah permintaan supaya saya menjadi besar," ujar Issumboshi. Putri mengayunkan palu dan memohon, "semoga Issumboshi menjadi besar!" Dengan ajaib, di depan matanya, Issumboshi menjadi besar. Mereka kembali ke istana, dan sang Putri meminta Raja mengizinkannya menikahi Issumboshi.</p><p></p><p>Sang Putri dan Issumboshi kemudian menikah, lalu mereka mengajak Kakek dan Nenek untuk tinggal bersama mereka di istana.

                            29. Once upon a time there was an old couple who didn’t havea child. They lived in a small house near the village forest. “Pleasegive us a child,” they asked God everyday.One day, from the household Shinto altar, they heard a cutecry, “Waa! Waa!”They looked and saw a crying baby who looked just like alittle figer. “This child must be a gift from God. Thanks to God!”“We will call this child ‘Issumboshi’,” they said.They raised Issumboshi with much care, but Issumboshinever grew bigger.“Hey, Issumboshi, do you want to be eaten by a frog?”Issumboshi was always being bullied by the children of the villageand often went home feeling unhappy.Grandmother would make some big rice balls and encouragehim. “Eat a lot, and grow up quickly,” Grandmother said.One day, Issumboshi said, “I will go to the capital to study andbecome a respectable person. Then I will come back.” Grandfatherand Grandmother were worried about him, but Issumboshi’s mindwould not be changed. At once they began to prepare for his trip.Issumboshi sheathed a needle sword in a straw case, puton a cup for a sedge hat, and started out with a chopstick staff, inhigh spirits.“I’m going now,” Issumboshi said.“Is he safe? With such a small body?” Grandfather andGrandmother asked as they saw him off.Issumboshi went on the trip with a big wish in a small body.… … …At last Issumboshi reached the capital city and anchoredunder the bridge. Then he climbed up to the railing and viewed thetown.“There is a fie palace over there. I shall ask them at once.”At long last Issumboshi arrived at the palace.“Excuse me, but I want to meet the feudal lord.”The lord came to the door, “What? Who’s there?”“Here I am, at your feet.”“Oh. How small! Why do you want to meet me?”“Please let me be your retainer.”“I wonder if your very small body can do anything.”“I’ll stay in your pocket and guard you from all harm.” WhenIssumboshi said so, a bee came buzzing by. “Yhaa!” Issumboshiyelled, stabbing the bee.“Bravo! I employ you. It would be good if you became thePrincess’s man.”“Oh! What a cute fellow he is!” said the Princess, puttingIssumboshi on her palm.“I will defend you upon my life,” said Issumboshi.The Princess liked Issumboshi, and she taught him reading,writing, and various studies. Further, Issumboshi practiced fencingvery hard in order to be strong.One day the Princess went out to worship at the KiyomizuTemple. Suddenly there was a strong wind, and some demonsappeared. The leader of the demons tried to grab the Princess.“Help me!” she screamed. Issumboshi tried to help her, but thedemon caught him and threw him into his mouth. Issumboshi,who was swallowed, jabbed and jabbed the demon’s stomach. Thedemon rolled over and spat out Issumboshi.Issumboshi jumped at the demon and stabbed his eyes. Theremaining demons were frightened. They ran away in great haste,but one demon, who was left behind, trembled while holding themagic hammer.“Do you want me to stab your eyes, too?” Issumboshi asked.“Please, don’t. This is the magic hammer that will grant youa wish. I give it to you, so please spare me.” And saying this, he ranoff in a hurry.“Thank you, Issumboshi. You have saved my life,” thePrincess said.“Princess, please wave this magic hammer and make a wishthat I may become big,” said Issumboshi. The Princess waved itand asked, “May Issumboshi become big!”And then, strangely, before her eyes, Issumboshi began togrow. He grew into a nice young man. They went back to the palace,and the Princess asked the King to let her marry Issumboshi.The Princess and Issumboshi then got married, and theyinvited Grandfather and Grandmother to live with them in thepalace.
