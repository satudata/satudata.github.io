                                            Since 1929, physicists have known that the universe is expanding. Most physicists hold that the entire observable universe was condensed into a tiny area of exceptional density and that this initial mass exploded outward in what is commonly referred to as the "Big Bang." The universe has been expanding steadily ever since this cataclysmic event and most physicists naturally assumed that this expansion must be gradually slowing down. Some theorists even predicted that the gravitational pull of the universe would cause the eventual contraction of the universe—the "Big Crunch." However, in 1998, a team of observers studying supernovae made a shocking discovery. Instead of slowing down, the expansion of the universe is accelerating. In fact, the acceleration appeared to have begun some 10 billion years ago. Later measurements of the cosmic microwave background and a survey of the distribution of galaxies seem to corroborate the initial finding that the expansion of the universe Is indeed accelerating. Cosmologists believe the most likely explanation for the acceleration of the universe's expansion is an entity known as dark energy According to theory, dark energy should account for approximately two-thirds of the total cosmic energy density. It also Is believed to be gravitationally repulsive and diffused throughout the areas of space unoccupied by galaxies. Although theoretically possible, dark energy, if it were found to exist, would provide theorists with a number of difficulties and perhaps even require an extensive rethinking of fundamental physics. Some cosmologists believe that the existence of dark energy implies the existence of subatomic particles more than thirty orders of magnitude smaller than the electron. Others have tinkered with Einstein's theory of relativity in an attempt to account for the perceived effects of dark energy. Such drastic revisions to long-held tenets have encouraged some physicists to seek a more conventional solution to the accelerating universe enigma, one that does not invoke the specter of dark energy. These theories posit more mundane explanations. such as the aggregate gravitational effect of interstellar dust. Recently, four independent groups have found evidence of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, a phenomenon linked to the presence of dark energy. 1) 1. The passage is primarily concerned with ....

Ramadhan
Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. It is the Islamic month of fasting, in which participating Muslims refrain from eating, drinking from dawn until sunset. Ramadan had been the name of the ninth month in Arabian culture long before the arrival of Islam. In the Qur'an it is said that "fasting has been written down (as obligatory) upon you, as it was upon those before you" which is a reference to the Jewish practice of fasting on Yom Kippur. Fasting is meant to teach the Muslim patience, modesty and spirituality.
Ramadan is a time for Muslims to fast for the sake of God and to offer more prayer than usual. During Ramadan, Muslims ask forgiveness for past sins, pray for guidance and help in refraining from everyday evils, and try to purify themselves through self-restraint and good deeds.
As compared to the solar calendar, the dates of Ramadan vary, moving backwards about ten days each year as it is a moving holiday depending on the moon. Ramadan was the month in which the first verses of the Qur'an were said to be revealed to the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. That was during a night that Muslims call Laylat al-Qadr (the night of decree or measures.) The night is believed to be one of the 10 last days of the month. Ramadan ends with Eid ul-Fitr on the first of Shawwal, with much celebration and feasting.

The Advantages of Prayer
    PRAYER is the essence of spirituality. It affords a wonderful recreation to the body, mind and soul. It brings in complete satisfaction and satiation which nothing else can give. The peace which comes with prayer is of a unique nature, quite unimaginable· A kind of serenity descends upon the subliminal self within.
    Prayer has in it a great dynamic force. It strengthens and befits a person to face and fight the battle of life fearlessly and successfully. It is in fact the only panacea for all types of ills: Adhi Bhutak (diseases and ailments), Adhi Devak (accidents over which man has no control), Adhi Atmic (evil propensities of the mind), and above all brings in inner peace and satiety. It buckles a person with courage and fortitude and brings about a complete reorientation.    Prayer is the key that unlocks the Kingdom of Heaven. It pulls up the sluice gates and releases from within immense power and resourcefulness.
Where all human efforts fail, there prayer succeeds.
Lord Tennyson tells us,
 . . More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of.
Even if prayer may seem to fail to avert calamity, yet it has the power to take the sting out of it. With an inner transformation there comes a change in the angle of vision, which greatly affects the outlook on life. Everything puts on a new mantle of color superbly Divine.
            Last but not least, prayer opens our eyes to Reality and enables us to see things in their true perspective. It gives new values to life and gradually transports an individual into a New World and initiates him into a New Order. With a life of prayer a person eventually rises into cosmic awareness and sees the hidden hand of God working out His will and His purpose which otherwise remains a sealed book too subtle for the average man to pierce through and peep into. The more this inner contact is established, the more Godhead is imbibed by the spirit. Only when a complete identification comes about does one become a conscious co-worker with Him.</a>

The proposed property includes the hill atop of which the main stupa is located, the hill top reliquary stupa and associated religious buildings and sacred statuary, bells, and other emblems situated on the hill, as well as the hill's surrounding sacred perimeter. The proposed property comprises a total area of 46.3 hectares. The stupa's plinth is made of bricks covered with genuine gold plates and the main stupa itself is entirely covered in gold, adorned with a crowning umbrella encrusted with diamonds and other jewels. Following a tradition began in the 15th century by the Queen Shin Sawbu (BinnyaThau), who donated her weight in gold to the pagoda, Buddhist devotees from all walks of life and all regions of Buddhist Asia, as well as monarchs throughout Burma's history, have donated gold to the Shwedagon in order to maintain the monument, and in so-doing gain merit, in this life and future lives. There are four covered monumental stairways leading from the four cardinal directions from the base of Singuttara Hill up to the main stupa. On the ascent to the main stupa, these stairways give access to three intermediary terraces, or platforms (pisssaya).On these platforms are located circumambulatory walkways around the hill punctuated with Buddhist monasteries and community lecture-cum-prayer halls (dhammayons). The main golden iconic reliquary stupa is located on the fourth, uppermost terrace/platform, surrounded by numerous pavilions and shrines, large bronze bells, and other decorative features related to Hindu-Buddhist iconography. The spatial siting of the attributes within the site is organized following a system derived from Hindu cosmology, indicated by cosmic pillars surrounding the central main reliquary stupa, which mark the planetary positions within the zodiac. The design of the site is an intentional recreation of the Hindu-Buddhist cosmos, reflected on earth.This is Istanbul's top attraction; the Church of the Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia) began as a Byzantine church, then it became a mosque during the Ottoman Era and today is a museum. It is without doubt a great architectural wonder. The original structure has not survived but it was constructed here in the 4th century under the founder of Constantinople, Constantine the Great. After the original building was destroyed Constantine's son Emperor Theodosius had a new church built in its place. The second structure burnt down in 532 but parts of it have been recovered through excavations. The structure we see today dates back to 532-537 when its construction was over seen by Justinian I. Although the church suffered from earthquakes and an attack by the Crusaders in 1204 It has retained its historic structure and decoration. From 1453 for 500 years the church became the main mosque of Istanbul during the Ottoman Era.The church was designed by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus; it has a classic basilica layout. The church features rich mosaics and a grand central dome with a diameter of 31 meters. The circular dome rests on a rectangular base all richly decorated with murals, Arabic calligraphy and mosaics. All the interior surfaces are polychrome marble in green, purple and white with gold mosaics. You can see the marble mihrab which has survived from the Ottoman Era. Of the many magnificent mosaics the most famous are on the upper floor galleries. From the galleries you have a wonderful view down to the nave. Outside in the church grounds there are several points of interest including mausoleums, a baptistery and some excavated remains.Bella : Have you thought about what you might like to do this weekend, Cita? Cita : I haven't given it much thought. Do you have any ideas?Bella : I was thinking of maybe going to the beach would be great. Cita : That sounds like a great idea! The weather has been great for the beach.Bella : Would you be interested in joining me? We can have fun together.Cita : Sure, I would love to to go with you there. So when would we be leaving? Bella : I thought that we could leave around 7:30 on Saturday morning. Cita : Yeah, that would give us plenty time to explore the beach feel the gentle breeze and the white sand beneath my feet. I also heard that this weekend there will be a kite festival on the Padang Garang beach in Sanur.Bella : I hope we are able to see the festival.Cita : By the way, thank you for inviting me to go to the beach with you. I'm really looking forward to Saturday. Bella : It's all right. See you on Saturday morning.Cita : See you too.​</a>

                                            tolong urutin dong : 
1. Tsunami is a natural disaster caused by the increasing waves of the sea to land with a high swiftness as the consequence of the quake which is centered under the ocean. The quake can be caused by land erosion, sifted plate, an erupted volcano as well as a meteoroid that falls in the ocean. Tsunami usually happens if the size of the earthquake exceeds until 7 on the Richter scale. This tsunami is quite dangerous, mainly for those who live around the beach. With great force, it will sweep out whatever around it. From all causes of tsunami, earthquake is the major cause.
2. Earthquake causes perpendicular layers motion of earth. As a result, the sea bottom is suddenly up and down, so that the balance of sea water was disturbed on it, similarly with cosmic objects or meteors that fall from above. If the size of a meteor or landslide is quite big, mega tsunami can happen with hundreds of meters high
3.Even though the movement of the ground is horizontal, but the energy of the earthquake is big, and it can cause the collapse of cliffs/hill on the sea automatically in which the movement is perpendicular to the surface of the sea. Although there is no earthquake that hits the land directly which results vertical movement, the condition of a cliff and hill in the sea has been unstable and because of the force of gravity and ocean currents that led to landslides, it causes tsunami.
4.The victim of tsunami is not a little. The casualties are hit by sluggish water flow and material that carried away by the tsunami. Besides the victim, tsunami also has a negative impact on the building, herbs, and pollution to agricultural land, and water.
5.Vertical movement of the earth crust because of a volcanic eruption, an earthquake, the avalanche or a meteor falling to earth can cause the sea floor becomes up or down suddenly therefore it disturbs the balance of water on it. This makes the occurrence of energy flow of sea water on the beach become large waves so that tsunami happens. Billows can spread to all directions. Energy which conceives in the wave of the tsunami is fixed on the function of the altitude. The height of waves in the sea is only about 1 meter. Thus, threat of a wave cannot be felt by a ship that was in the middle of the sea. When it approaches the coast, the speed of the tsunami of decline until about 30 miles per hour, but its height has increased to reach tens of meters. When it reaches the coast, tsunami enters the land until hundreds of meters, even kilometers.
6.An earthquake on the bottom of sea gives rise to an affliction of the sea water that caused by the change of the profile of the ocean floor that generally occurs because of a tectonics earthquake and perpendicular (vertical) ground motion with the surface of the sea water or earth surface. If the movements of the ground are horizontal on the surface of the sea, there will not happen tsunami.</a>

Short Biography of Andrei SakharovAlthough he helped design the atomic bomb and was considered the key scientist in the development of the hydrogen bomb, Andrei Sakharov later become known as a political activist who worked endlessly to promote political and intellectual freedom. He believed strongly in a system where anyone could access information upon his or her own will, gather facts and opinions, and speak to others about them to prevent the downfall of modern society by those who control the masses to become malevolent dictators. Educated in Moscow at the State University in 1938, he had to continue his studies in Turkmenistan due to the Great Patriotic War that took place in 1941. In 1945, he was able to return to Moscow where he studied under the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In 1947, he obtained his Ph.D. With an interest in cosmology, especially the energy possessed by cosmic rays, Sakharov never got to pursue the field because of his increased involvement in the development of the Soviet’s atomic bomb program. Upon the development of the atomic weapon, he was instrumental in increasing the power of the hydrogen bomb using what was called the Sloika design. He then furthered his endeavors by helping create the first megaton-range Soviet Hydrogen Bomb, which would become the biggest, most powerful bomb ever devised. After a few years, he then went to work on nuclear fusion reactors that could be used for mass energy production. However, after Andrei Sakharov saw what his work was being used for – namely the arms race against the U.S. and an increase in atomic bomb production – he thought over the issue and turned his scientific endeavors into ones that incorporated ideas for the betterment of society as a whole, especially those with regard to human rights.</a>

The Fourth State of Matter 
There are three classic states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas; however, plasma is considered by 
some scientists to be the fourth state of matter. The plasma state is not related to blood plasma, the
most common usage of the word; rather, the term has been used in physics since the 1920s to 
represent an ionized gas. Lightning is commonly seen as a form of plasma. 
Plasma is found in both ordinary and exotic places. When an electric current is passed through neon 
gas, it produces both plasma and light. Lightning is a massive electrical discharge in the atmosphere 
that creates a jagged column of plasma. Part of a comet's streaming tail is plasma from gas ionized 
by sunlight and other unknown processes. The Sun is a 1.5-millionkilometer ball of plasma. It is 
heated by nuclear fusion. 
Scientists study plasma for practical purposes. In an effort to harness fusion energy on Earth, 
physicists are studying devices that create and confine very hot plasmas in magnetic fields. Inspace, plasma processes are largely responsible for shielding Earth from cosmic radiation, and much of the Sun's influence on Earth occurs by energy transfer through the ionized layers of the upper atmosphere.</a>

As a young Portuguese noble, he served the king of Portugal, but he became involved in the quagmire of political intrigue at court and lost the king's favor. After he was dismissed from service by the king of Portugal, he offered to serve the future Emperor Charles V of Spain.A papal decree of 1493 had assigned all land in the New World west of 50 degrees W longitude to Spain and all the land east of that line to Portugal. Magellan offered to prove that the East Indies fell under Spanish authority. On September 20, 1519, Magellan set sail from Spain with five ships. More than a year later, one of these ships was exploring the topography of South America in search of a water route across the continent. This ship sank, but the remaining four ships searched along the southern peninsula of South America. Finally they found the passage they sought near 50 degrees S latitude. Magellan named this passage the Strait of All Saints, but today it is known as the Strait of Magellan.One ship deserted while in this passage and returned to Spain, so fewer sailors were privileged to gaze at that first panorama of the Pacific Ocean. Those who remained crossed the meridian now known as the International Date Line in the early spring of 1521 after 98 days on the Pacific Ocean. During those long days at sea, many of Magellan's men died of starvation and disease.Later, Magellan became involved in an insular conflict in the Philippines and was killed in a tribal battle. Only one ship and 17 sailors under the command of the Basque navigator Elcano survived to complete the westward journey to Spain and thus prove once and for all that the world is round, with no precipice at the edge.1.

Magellan lost the favor of the king of Portugal when he became involved in a political ________. A. entanglement B. discussion C. negotiation D. problem E. None of the above3. The Pope divided New World lands between Spain and Portugal according to their location on one side or the other of an imaginary geographical line 50 degrees west of Greenwich that extends in a _________ direction. A. north and south B. crosswise C. easterly D. south east E. north and west4. One of Magellan's ships explored the _________ of South America for a passage across the continent. A. coastline B. mountain range C. physical features D. islands E. None of the above5. Four of the ships sought a passage along a southern ______.

                            12. Since 1929, physicists have known that the universe is expanding. Most physicists hold that the entire observable universe was condensed into a tiny area of exceptional density and that this initial mass exploded outward in what is commonly referred to as the "Big Bang." The universe has been expanding steadily ever since this cataclysmic event and most physicists naturally assumed that this expansion must be gradually slowing down. Some theorists even predicted that the gravitational pull of the universe would cause the eventual contraction of the universe—the "Big Crunch." However, in 1998, a team of observers studying supernovae made a shocking discovery. Instead of slowing down, the expansion of the universe is accelerating. In fact, the acceleration appeared to have begun some 10 billion years ago. Later measurements of the cosmic microwave background and a survey of the distribution of galaxies seem to corroborate the initial finding that the expansion of the universe Is indeed accelerating. Cosmologists believe the most likely explanation for the acceleration of the universe's expansion is an entity known as dark energy According to theory, dark energy should account for approximately two-thirds of the total cosmic energy density. It also Is believed to be gravitationally repulsive and diffused throughout the areas of space unoccupied by galaxies. Although theoretically possible, dark energy, if it were found to exist, would provide theorists with a number of difficulties and perhaps even require an extensive rethinking of fundamental physics. Some cosmologists believe that the existence of dark energy implies the existence of subatomic particles more than thirty orders of magnitude smaller than the electron. Others have tinkered with Einstein's theory of relativity in an attempt to account for the perceived effects of dark energy. Such drastic revisions to long-held tenets have encouraged some physicists to seek a more conventional solution to the accelerating universe enigma, one that does not invoke the specter of dark energy. These theories posit more mundane explanations. such as the aggregate gravitational effect of interstellar dust. Recently, four independent groups have found evidence of the integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, a phenomenon linked to the presence of dark energy. 1) 1. The passage is primarily concerned with ....

Ramadhan
Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. It is the Islamic month of fasting, in which participating Muslims refrain from eating, drinking from dawn until sunset. Ramadan had been the name of the ninth month in Arabian culture long before the arrival of Islam. In the Qur'an it is said that "fasting has been written down (as obligatory) upon you, as it was upon those before you" which is a reference to the Jewish practice of fasting on Yom Kippur. Fasting is meant to teach the Muslim patience, modesty and spirituality.
Ramadan is a time for Muslims to fast for the sake of God and to offer more prayer than usual. During Ramadan, Muslims ask forgiveness for past sins, pray for guidance and help in refraining from everyday evils, and try to purify themselves through self-restraint and good deeds.
As compared to the solar calendar, the dates of Ramadan vary, moving backwards about ten days each year as it is a moving holiday depending on the moon. Ramadan was the month in which the first verses of the Qur'an were said to be revealed to the Islamic Prophet Muhammad. That was during a night that Muslims call Laylat al-Qadr (the night of decree or measures.) The night is believed to be one of the 10 last days of the month. Ramadan ends with Eid ul-Fitr on the first of Shawwal, with much celebration and feasting.

The Advantages of Prayer
    PRAYER is the essence of spirituality. It affords a wonderful recreation to the body, mind and soul. It brings in complete satisfaction and satiation which nothing else can give. The peace which comes with prayer is of a unique nature, quite unimaginable· A kind of serenity descends upon the subliminal self within.
    Prayer has in it a great dynamic force. It strengthens and befits a person to face and fight the battle of life fearlessly and successfully. It is in fact the only panacea for all types of ills: Adhi Bhutak (diseases and ailments), Adhi Devak (accidents over which man has no control), Adhi Atmic (evil propensities of the mind), and above all brings in inner peace and satiety. It buckles a person with courage and fortitude and brings about a complete reorientation.    Prayer is the key that unlocks the Kingdom of Heaven. It pulls up the sluice gates and releases from within immense power and resourcefulness.
Where all human efforts fail, there prayer succeeds.
Lord Tennyson tells us,
 . . More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of.
Even if prayer may seem to fail to avert calamity, yet it has the power to take the sting out of it. With an inner transformation there comes a change in the angle of vision, which greatly affects the outlook on life. Everything puts on a new mantle of color superbly Divine.
            Last but not least, prayer opens our eyes to Reality and enables us to see things in their true perspective. It gives new values to life and gradually transports an individual into a New World and initiates him into a New Order. With a life of prayer a person eventually rises into cosmic awareness and sees the hidden hand of God working out His will and His purpose which otherwise remains a sealed book too subtle for the average man to pierce through and peep into. The more this inner contact is established, the more Godhead is imbibed by the spirit. Only when a complete identification comes about does one become a conscious co-worker with Him.</h2><br />

Try to understand them well by looking for some new vocabularies, including their antonym and synonym*The Shwedagon Pagoda, situated on Singuttara Hill in the center of Yangon (Rangoon), is the most sacred Buddhist stupa in Myanmar and one of the most important religious reliquary monuments in the world and also one of famous tourist attractions. The proposed property includes the hill atop of which the main stupa is located, the hill top reliquary stupa and associated religious buildings and sacred statuary, bells, and other emblems situated on the hill, as well as the hill's surrounding sacred perimeter. The proposed property comprises a total area of 46.3 hectares. The stupa's plinth is made of bricks covered with genuine gold plates and the main stupa itself is entirely covered in gold, adorned with a crowning umbrella encrusted with diamonds and other jewels. Following a tradition began in the 15th century by the Queen Shin Sawbu (BinnyaThau), who donated her weight in gold to the pagoda, Buddhist devotees from all walks of life and all regions of Buddhist Asia, as well as monarchs throughout Burma's history, have donated gold to the Shwedagon in order to maintain the monument, and in so-doing gain merit, in this life and future lives. There are four covered monumental stairways leading from the four cardinal directions from the base of Singuttara Hill up to the main stupa. On the ascent to the main stupa, these stairways give access to three intermediary terraces, or platforms (pisssaya).On these platforms are located circumambulatory walkways around the hill punctuated with Buddhist monasteries and community lecture-cum-prayer halls (dhammayons). The main golden iconic reliquary stupa is located on the fourth, uppermost terrace/platform, surrounded by numerous pavilions and shrines, large bronze bells, and other decorative features related to Hindu-Buddhist iconography. The spatial siting of the attributes within the site is organized following a system derived from Hindu cosmology, indicated by cosmic pillars surrounding the central main reliquary stupa, which mark the planetary positions within the zodiac. The design of the site is an intentional recreation of the Hindu-Buddhist cosmos, reflected on earth.This is Istanbul's top attraction; the Church of the Holy Wisdom (Hagia Sophia) began as a Byzantine church, then it became a mosque during the Ottoman Era and today is a museum. It is without doubt a great architectural wonder. The original structure has not survived but it was constructed here in the 4th century under the founder of Constantinople, Constantine the Great. After the original building was destroyed Constantine's son Emperor Theodosius had a new church built in its place. The second structure burnt down in 532 but parts of it have been recovered through excavations. The structure we see today dates back to 532-537 when its construction was over seen by Justinian I. Although the church suffered from earthquakes and an attack by the Crusaders in 1204 It has retained its historic structure and decoration. From 1453 for 500 years the church became the main mosque of Istanbul during the Ottoman Era.The church was designed by Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus; it has a classic basilica layout. The church features rich mosaics and a grand central dome with a diameter of 31 meters. The circular dome rests on a rectangular base all richly decorated with murals, Arabic calligraphy and mosaics. All the interior surfaces are polychrome marble in green, purple and white with gold mosaics. You can see the marble mihrab which has survived from the Ottoman Era. Of the many magnificent mosaics the most famous are on the upper floor galleries. From the galleries you have a wonderful view down to the nave. Outside in the church grounds there are several points of interest including mausoleums, a baptistery and some excavated remains.Bella : Have you thought about what you might like to do this weekend, Cita?

                            18. tolong urutin dong : 
1. Tsunami is a natural disaster caused by the increasing waves of the sea to land with a high swiftness as the consequence of the quake which is centered under the ocean. The quake can be caused by land erosion, sifted plate, an erupted volcano as well as a meteoroid that falls in the ocean. Tsunami usually happens if the size of the earthquake exceeds until 7 on the Richter scale. This tsunami is quite dangerous, mainly for those who live around the beach. With great force, it will sweep out whatever around it. From all causes of tsunami, earthquake is the major cause.
2. Earthquake causes perpendicular layers motion of earth. As a result, the sea bottom is suddenly up and down, so that the balance of sea water was disturbed on it, similarly with cosmic objects or meteors that fall from above. If the size of a meteor or landslide is quite big, mega tsunami can happen with hundreds of meters high
3.Even though the movement of the ground is horizontal, but the energy of the earthquake is big, and it can cause the collapse of cliffs/hill on the sea automatically in which the movement is perpendicular to the surface of the sea. Although there is no earthquake that hits the land directly which results vertical movement, the condition of a cliff and hill in the sea has been unstable and because of the force of gravity and ocean currents that led to landslides, it causes tsunami.
4.The victim of tsunami is not a little. The casualties are hit by sluggish water flow and material that carried away by the tsunami. Besides the victim, tsunami also has a negative impact on the building, herbs, and pollution to agricultural land, and water.
5.Vertical movement of the earth crust because of a volcanic eruption, an earthquake, the avalanche or a meteor falling to earth can cause the sea floor becomes up or down suddenly therefore it disturbs the balance of water on it. This makes the occurrence of energy flow of sea water on the beach become large waves so that tsunami happens. Billows can spread to all directions. Energy which conceives in the wave of the tsunami is fixed on the function of the altitude. The height of waves in the sea is only about 1 meter. Thus, threat of a wave cannot be felt by a ship that was in the middle of the sea. When it approaches the coast, the speed of the tsunami of decline until about 30 miles per hour, but its height has increased to reach tens of meters. When it reaches the coast, tsunami enters the land until hundreds of meters, even kilometers.
6.An earthquake on the bottom of sea gives rise to an affliction of the sea water that caused by the change of the profile of the ocean floor that generally occurs because of a tectonics earthquake and perpendicular (vertical) ground motion with the surface of the sea water or earth surface. If the movements of the ground are horizontal on the surface of the sea, there will not happen tsunami.</h2><br />

Heat,too, makes our environment tolerable and some ultraviolet rays penetrate theatmosphere.

Radiation is thegreatest known danger to explorers in space, but their spacesuits or the walls of theirspacecraft do prevent a log of radiation damage.We all receive radiation here on Earth from the sun, from cosmic rays and fromradioactive minerals. The trouble is that it is extremely difficult to be sure aboutradiation damage-a person may feel well, but the cell of his or her reproduction organmay be damaged, and this will not be discovered until the birth of (deformed) children oreven grandchildren.

                            20. TsunamiTsunami is a natural disaster caused by the increasing waves of the sea to land with a high swiftness as the consequence of the quake which is centred under the ocean. The quake can be caused by land erosion, sifted plate, an erupted volcano as well as a meteoroid that falls in the ocean. Tsunami usually happens if the size of the earthquake exceed until 7 on the Richter scale. This tsunami is quite dangerous, mainly for those who live around the beach. With great force, it will sweep out whatever around it. From all causes of tsunami, earthquake is the major cause.An earthquake on the bottom of sea gives rise to an affliction of the sea water that caused by the change of the profile of the ocean floor that generally occurs because of a tectonics earthquake and perpendicular (vertical) ground motion with the surface of the sea water or earth surface. If the movements of the ground are horizontal on the surface of the sea, there will not happen tsunami.Even though the movement of the ground is horizontal, but the energy of the earthquake is big, and it can cause the collapse of cliffs/hill on the sea automatically in which the movement is perpendicular to the surface of the sea. Although there is no earthquake that hits the land directly which results vertical movement, the condition of a cliff and hill in the sea has been unstable and because of the force of gravity and ocean currents that led to landslides, it causes tsunami.Earthquake causes perpendicular layers motion of earth. As a result, the sea bottom is suddenly up and down, so that the balance of sea water was disturbed on it, similarly with cosmic objects or meteors that fall from above. If the size of a meteor or landslide is quite big, megatsunami can happen with hundreds of meters high.Vertical movement of the earth crust because of a volcanic eruption, an earthquake, the avalanche or a meteor falling to earth can cause the sea floor becomes up or down suddenly therefore it disturbs the balance of water on it. This makes the occurrence of energy flow of sea water on the beach become large waves so that tsunami happens. Billows can spread to all directions. Energy which conceives in the wave of the tsunami is fixed on the function of the altitude. The height of waves in the sea is only about 1 meter. Thus, the rate of a wave cannot be felt by a ship that was in the middle of the sea. When it approaches the coast, the speed of the tsunami of decline until about 30 miles per hour, but its height has increased to reach tens of meters. When it reaches the coast, tsunami enters the land until hundreds of meters, even kilometres.The victim of tsunami is not a little. The casualties are hit by sluggish water flow and material that carried away by the tsunami. Besides the victim, tsunami also has a negative impact on the building, herbs, and pollution to agricultural land, and water.tolong dibantu kak, pertanyaan nya di gambar, terimakasih​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Tsunami</p><p> Tsunami adalah bencana alam yang disebabkan oleh meningkatnya gelombang laut untuk mendarat dengan kecepatan tinggi sebagai akibat dari gempa yang berpusat di bawah laut. Gempa dapat disebabkan oleh erosi tanah, plat yang diayak, sebuah gunung berapi yang telah meletus dan juga meteoroid yang jatuh di lautan. Tsunami biasanya terjadi jika ukuran gempa melebihi hingga 7 skala Richter. Tsunami ini cukup berbahaya, terutama bagi mereka yang tinggal di sekitar pantai. Dengan kekuatan besar, itu akan menyapu apa pun di sekitarnya. Dari semua penyebab tsunami, gempa bumi adalah penyebab utama. Gempa bumi di dasar laut menimbulkan penderitaan air laut yang disebabkan oleh perubahan profil dasar samudra yang umumnya terjadi karena gempa tektonik dan gerakan tanah tegak lurus dengan permukaan air laut atau permukaan bumi. Jika pergerakan tanah horizontal pada permukaan laut, tidak akan terjadi tsunami. Meskipun gerakan tanah itu horizontal, tetapi energi gempa bumi besar, dan dapat menyebabkan runtuhnya tebing/bukit di laut secara otomatis di mana gerakan itu tegak lurus ke permukaan laut. Meskipun tidak ada gempa bumi yang hits tanah langsung yang menghasilkan gerakan vertikal, kondisi tebing dan bukit di laut telah stabil dan karena gaya gravitasi dan arus laut yang menyebabkan tanah longsor, itu menyebabkan tsunami.

Short Biography of Andrei SakharovAlthough he helped design the atomic bomb and was considered the key scientist in the development of the hydrogen bomb, Andrei Sakharov later become known as a political activist who worked endlessly to promote political and intellectual freedom. He believed strongly in a system where anyone could access information upon his or her own will, gather facts and opinions, and speak to others about them to prevent the downfall of modern society by those who control the masses to become malevolent dictators. Educated in Moscow at the State University in 1938, he had to continue his studies in Turkmenistan due to the Great Patriotic War that took place in 1941. In 1945, he was able to return to Moscow where he studied under the Soviet Academy of Sciences. In 1947, he obtained his Ph.D. With an interest in cosmology, especially the energy possessed by cosmic rays, Sakharov never got to pursue the field because of his increased involvement in the development of the Soviet’s atomic bomb program. Upon the development of the atomic weapon, he was instrumental in increasing the power of the hydrogen bomb using what was called the Sloika design. He then furthered his endeavors by helping create the first megaton-range Soviet Hydrogen Bomb, which would become the biggest, most powerful bomb ever devised. After a few years, he then went to work on nuclear fusion reactors that could be used for mass energy production. However, after Andrei Sakharov saw what his work was being used for – namely the arms race against the U.S. and an increase in atomic bomb production – he thought over the issue and turned his scientific endeavors into ones that incorporated ideas for the betterment of society as a whole, especially those with regard to human rights.</h2><br />

While it once was a haven for scruffy backpackers, cosmic seekers, artist and bohemians, Ubud is now a hot spot for literati, is now a hot spot for literati, glitterati, art collectors and concesseurs, Famous names walk its busy sidewalks every day Clegant five star hotels and sprawling mansions now stand on its outskirts, overlooking the most pred views in Bali. Nonetheless, Ubud is still popular with backpackers, mystics and all the finest fringe elements of global society. Ubud is not ruined" Its character is too strong to be destroyed. It still draws people whoadd something, people who are actively involved in art, nature, anthropology, music,dance, architecture, environmentalism, "alternative modalities, and more.Ubud is arguably the best place to use as a base if you're visiting Ball, if you're looking for culture, comfort, nature and inspiration. Ubud is surrounded by most of the things that bring people to Ball -- Scenic rice fields, small villages, art and craft communities, ancient temples, palaces, rivers, cheap accommodation and unique luxury hotels.

The Fourth State of Matter 
There are three classic states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas; however, plasma is considered by 
some scientists to be the fourth state of matter. The plasma state is not related to blood plasma, the
most common usage of the word; rather, the term has been used in physics since the 1920s to 
represent an ionized gas. Lightning is commonly seen as a form of plasma. 
Plasma is found in both ordinary and exotic places. When an electric current is passed through neon 
gas, it produces both plasma and light. Lightning is a massive electrical discharge in the atmosphere 
that creates a jagged column of plasma. Part of a comet's streaming tail is plasma from gas ionized 
by sunlight and other unknown processes. The Sun is a 1.5-millionkilometer ball of plasma. It is 
heated by nuclear fusion. 
Scientists study plasma for practical purposes. In an effort to harness fusion energy on Earth, 
physicists are studying devices that create and confine very hot plasmas in magnetic fields. Inspace, plasma processes are largely responsible for shielding Earth from cosmic radiation, and much of the Sun's influence on Earth occurs by energy transfer through the ionized layers of the upper atmosphere.</h2><br />

As a young Portuguese noble, he served the king of Portugal, but he became involved in the quagmire of political intrigue at court and lost the king's favor. After he was dismissed from service by the king of Portugal, he offered to serve the future Emperor Charles V of Spain.A papal decree of 1493 had assigned all land in the New World west of 50 degrees W longitude to Spain and all the land east of that line to Portugal. Magellan offered to prove that the East Indies fell under Spanish authority. On September 20, 1519, Magellan set sail from Spain with five ships. More than a year later, one of these ships was exploring the topography of South America in search of a water route across the continent. This ship sank, but the remaining four ships searched along the southern peninsula of South America. Finally they found the passage they sought near 50 degrees S latitude. Magellan named this passage the Strait of All Saints, but today it is known as the Strait of Magellan.One ship deserted while in this passage and returned to Spain, so fewer sailors were privileged to gaze at that first panorama of the Pacific Ocean. Those who remained crossed the meridian now known as the International Date Line in the early spring of 1521 after 98 days on the Pacific Ocean. During those long days at sea, many of Magellan's men died of starvation and disease.Later, Magellan became involved in an insular conflict in the Philippines and was killed in a tribal battle. Only one ship and 17 sailors under the command of the Basque navigator Elcano survived to complete the westward journey to Spain and thus prove once and for all that the world is round, with no precipice at the edge.1.

                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Cosmic Distance Ladder</p><p></p><p>Akarsh Simha</p><p>The cosmic distance ladder refers to the succession of different methods that astronomers use to measure distances to objects in the sky. Some methods, like parallax, work well for only nearby objects. Other methods, like using the cosmological redshift, work only for very distance galaxies. Thus, there are several methods, each with its own limited validity, and hence the name.</p><p></p><p>Direct measurements</p><p></p><p>The bottom of the ladder consists of objects whose distances can be directly measured, like the moon (see Lunar Laser Ranging). The same technique, using radio waves, is applied to find distances to planets as well.</p><p></p><p>For nearby stars, measuring the parallax is possible and yields the distance to the star.</p><p></p><p>Standard candles</p><p></p><p>"Standard candles" are objects whose intrinsic brightnesses we can know for sure. The apparent magnitude, which is easy to measure, tells us how bright an object appears, not how bright it actually is. Distant objects appear less brighter, because their light gets spread out over a larger area.</p><p></p><p>In accordance with the inverse square law for light intensities, the amount of light we receive from an object drops with the distance squared. Thus, we may compute the distance to an object if we know both how bright it actually is (absolute magnitude; 'M') and how bright it appears to us on earth (apparent magnitude; 'm'). We may define the distance modulus as follows:</p><p></p><p>Distance Modulus = M - m = 5 log10 d - 5</p><p></p><p>Here 'd' is the distance measured in parsecs.</p><p></p><p>For these special standard candle objects, we have some other way of knowing their intrinsic brightness, and thereby can calculate their distance.</p><p></p><p>Common "standard candles" used in astronomy are:</p><p></p><p>Cepheid Variables: A kind of periodic variable star, whose variation period is related to the luminosity</p><p></p><p>RR Lyrae Variables: Another such periodic variable star with a well-known period-luminosity relationship</p><p></p><p>Type-Ia supernovae: These supernovae have a very well-defined luminosity as a result of the physics that governs them and hence serve as standard-candles</p><p></p><p>Other methods</p><p></p><p>There are many other methods. Some of them rely on the physics of stars, such as the relationship between luminosity and color for various types of stars (this is usually represented on a Hertzsprung-Russel Diagram). Some of them work for star clusters, such as the Moving cluster method and the main-sequence fitting method. The Tully-Fisher relation that relates the brightness of a spiral galaxy to its rotation can be used to find the distance modulus, since the rotation of a galaxy is easy to measure using Doppler shift. Distances to distant galaxies may be found by measuring the Cosmological redshift, which is the redshift of light from distance galaxies that results from the expansion of the universe.</p><p></p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p>Semoga membantu maaf kalo salah.</p><p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>Cosmic Distances
